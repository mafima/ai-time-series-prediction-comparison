## DEMO

[![DEMO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fm4CaIVge2E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm4CaIVge2E)


## requirements and install
- install all requirements. on windows: run "requirements.sh". on others: check requirements.txt.
- install tensorflow - optional: install tensorflow-GPU support

tensorflow

used only by 1 method (LSTM)

## input data


| group | datapoints | stock tickers |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Saisonal  | 8799  | 7 |
| Trend  | 6286 | 5 |
| Index  | 14731 | 3 |
| total  | 29816 | 15 |

as input data stock market prices are used.
new input data can be generated by a webcrawler located in the data folder.
input data is read from the "data" folder. containing files can be changed. new predictions will be generated on the new data.
datamanipulation and visualisation can be done with the scripts in the data folder.
by default you can compare the same dataset with multiple approaches.


## approaches / methods for predictions
current prediction methods you can use:

- Holtwinters
features: config, split, normalisation, forecast, evaluation, visualisation
- ARIMA
features: config, split, normalisation, forecast, evaluation, visualisation
- LSTM
features: config, datanormalisation, split, forecast, evaluation

## results and comparison

| approach | error (mean MAPE, lower is better) |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Holt-Winters  | 11.4325  |
| ARIMA  | 10.3055  |
| LSTM  | 6.8266 |

prediction visualisation - use the same class for visualising
evaluation - basic np evaluation function for getting error
result visualisation

## Run Everything:
To run ALL functions of the program you can run the run.py class!
This will start all methods and will show you the new results when done.

## base features for comparing
datapipeline - compare the same dataset with multiple approaches
datafiles, datamanipulation and visualisation
visualisation - use the same class for visualising in all of them
